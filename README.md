# Personal Website

## What is the purpose of this website?

I created this website mainly because I wanted to learn a solid foundation for full stack development without using any dependencies (external frameworks/libraries).
However I did **NOT** want to follow or copy someone elses idea of a good project... I wanted to have an original idea that was also useful/valuabe to me and those in my immediate circle!

## Where did the inspiration come from?
  
A few years ago I started cooking alot of new recipes, so I made a Google Sheets database for all the recipes that I really enjoyed. This was the start to my cooking journey which has led many of my family and friends asking for recipes and instructions.
  
I am always having to pull out a pen and paper when I am making food in order to adjust proportions (especially when baking).
I also never understood why more cooking websites do not have this feature...

So I made website that: 
1. Stores my recipes inside a JSON database 
2. A light weight client side JavaScript application that automatically adjusts recipe proportions 
3. Dynamic PHP pages that automatically add new recipes from the JSON database 
4. A contact page with server side validation using PHP
  
## How did you learn how to do this?
  
A couple youtube tutorials at first but these were time consuming, hard to remember and I found myself being very dependant on their coding styles. So most of my learning came from [freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). They have a great system that involves ALOT of practice which I wanted.. 

*'Knowledge is only a rumor until it is experienced inside the body'*
  
## Future improvements and new features:

This list is ordered in terms of my top priorities:

1. ~~Fix any known bugs/issues/spelling in the current version (Gather site feedback feedback from launch on Jan 29, 2021)~~
2. ~~Clean up files so it is easier to read/clone - I chose to wait so I can use/learn git bash~~
3. Use/Learn popular frameworks and update/clean up my code where I see fit
4. Using said frameworks create a seperate *'my personal time scheduling web app'* that I can merge in eventually to the site
5. Add more client side features such as:
  5.1 Converting between weight <-> volume units (I just chosed the ones I use in the current version)
  5.2 Converting from Instant Yeast <-> Fresh Yeast <-> Sourdough Yest and adjust the steps involved
  5.3 Creating a login system where users can comment and share information *This will likely take a while to learn how to do this*
  5.4 Create a new page that allows users to enter new recipe data to the database *Highly likely I wont allow this*
